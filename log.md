### Day 0: 16 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solve a codewars Kata

**Thoughts:** Was good, is a slow start but was quick to start with, is good to get in touch with some challenge, and even I'm just doing the codewars is cool to face something different 

### Day 1: 17 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solve a codewars Kata 2

**Thoughts:** Was a bit boring the Kata's are not interesting but I kept going I need to find better things to work on


### Day 2: 18 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Start my date calculator 

**Thoughts:** This is something that I want to work a lot, I use a date calculator all the time and would be good to have one that is just mine, today progress was good, got a lot of the functionality done, It might take me another day to get it ready, is been good to keep the habit of coding everyday, I wasn't feeling at all today but I persisted and got something that I wanted done, that is quite good, I feel that is quite hard for me to build a habit but if I keep pushing will happen
